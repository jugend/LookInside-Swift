# LookInside-Swift

Trying out Swift, converted WWDC 2014 LookInside demo app from Objective-C to Swift. Re-organized the codebase in folders, and refactored some parts of the codes for readability.

This example shows how to use a custom presentation controller to create a custom view controller presentation. It provides a transitioning delegate to the view controller, which vends a presentation controller and animator object.
