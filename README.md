# LookInside-Swift

Apple's LookInside demo app in Swift. Grouped the codebase in different folders and did a bit of refactoring for readability.

This example shows how to use a custom presentation controller to create a custom view controller presentation. It provides a transitioning delegate to the view controller, which vends a presentation controller and animator object.
